Basically, the top button will select the first range for  "abcdefghijklm nopqrstuvwxyz" (ie, a through i), the middle button will select the middle range (j through q), and the bottom button the last range (r through z). Then, after the first click, the range will be divided again into thirds, and each button will access the respective third. After the second click, there should be three letters in the range, leaving each button to a letter. So, three clicks on the top is "A", three on the bottom is "Z", three middle is " ", and, for example, one top, one bottom, one middle is "H"
