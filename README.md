					Tertiary Text for Pebble
					￼

					About
					Type using your Pebble! Tertiary text presents working demo for a quick and efficient and method of entering text using only the Pebble itself. By fully utilizing the three buttons and narrowing down the selection each time, it is possible to hit all twenty-six characters of the alphabet in three button strokes.

					Usage
					The process may be effective, but it admittedly isn't the most straightforward. Check the animation to the right to get a better idea of how it functions. Also see the diagram below:  ￼  On the start screen, all 26 letters + the space are shown in three groups of nine, one group corresponding to each button. Selecting the top button then, for example, breaks it down into the group of nine, dividing that one into three groups of three, again one group for each button. The second click will then do the same thing to the selected group, making three groups of one letter each. The third and final click will then select the letter that it corresponds to, and successfully type it!
					Of course there are more than the 26 lower case letters that need to be typed, and have we not just made use all the three available buttons? Well, there is something else we can do in the current SDK:  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼  Right now, holding the center button blacks out the screen, hiding the notes from people that may be looking. To unblacken the screen, hold the center button again. This is more of a dummy feature just to prevent the app from being completely useless. In the future, once the API supports it, the middle button will have the roll of "sending" the data (akin to an enter or a confirm.) You can play with the .pbw file below to get a feel for how it works.

					You can get the PBW file here. Keep in mind that it is, for the most part, a demonstration of typing text. The Pebble API, as of yet, does not support API bluetooth messages (so the data can't be sent to the phone), and it also does not support saving data, so anything that you type will be wiped when you exit the app.  Again, this makes for an effective demo, but, at the moment, nothing more. Additional updates will be pushed to keep up with the SDK. Of course, if you can find a use for it within your own Pebble application, you can check out the source code below and implement it yourself (instructions also included!)

					The source is available on github and is licensed under the GPLv2 license. Feel free to contribute or adjust any small features / bugs as you feel fit! Together we can all bring the most useful, attractive, and effective text input solution to the Pebble! Perhaps with time we could even gain some official attention from the Pebble dev team. ;)
					I would like to make an official typing API, but the effort may be wasted with the impending Pebble SDK changes coming up. In the future, though.
